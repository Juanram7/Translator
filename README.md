# OpenNMT - Translator for a Mayan Language
## Description
* Jakalteka/popti is one of the many Mayan languages still spoken today.
* Making a translator could further help the indigenous community that still utilizes their native language.
* Using OpenNMT we can train a model using the translation by professionals from ALMG in Guatemala.
